I’ve finished more than 5 big projects related to iOS application. 
During my research period, I familiarized myself to CRUD, getting and sending data to the database using APIs, using Firebase and using CocoaPods and managing my parts on Bitbucket to work with the team. 

**Project 1 ([Balance](https://apps.apple.com/kr/app/%EB%B0%9C%EB%9E%80%EC%8A%A4-%EC%9A%B4%EB%8F%99-%EC%98%81%EC%96%91-%EC%9D%BC%EC%A7%80/id1564380829))**  
This project aimed at implementing an app for users to efficiently carry out daily workouts by tracking the workouts as well as the food they eat. There was the trainer part of the application and a normal user part of the application where the user was able to switch between the two types of users.

-    retrieve data from the distinguishing algorithm.
